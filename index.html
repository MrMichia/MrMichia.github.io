    <p>I have technological skills in various practices including website development  through HTML/CSS/JavaScript/SQL and coding skills involving languages like C/C++, Java, and Python.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I am interested in getting hands on experience in a technology driven work environment and my goal is to get my foot in the door for a future career in the I.T. field. I have had multiple jobs in the past where customer service was of the highest priority and I feel as if I can provide an effective presence to not only coworkers but to customers as well. I am advancing my skills in web development and database management through my classes at FSU and am actively seeking to expand my knowledge on general technological skills outside of my school work through freelance game development and certification persual.</p>
